# Note

its my first time posting a project on github and its my first bash script that has actualy more than 50 lines, as you can expect there could be bugs and bad code,

# Installation

download the script, (you can copy paste the script into an .sh file if you want) and make it executable

```console
chmod +x timecomp.sh
```

# Usage

you can print the help message via "timecomp.sh -h" (it also has nice colors!1!!11111)

usage:

timecomp.sh -a [command1] [command2] (replace [command1] and [command2] with your commands of course)
timecomp.sh -r (this will ask you commands)
timecomp.sh -v (I forgot adding it '_' its probally added right now but it has only 1 version so its pretty useless command)
